# Iris Classifier

This small project is a direct implementation (in vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript) of the [IrisAPI](https://github.com/avramaral/IrisAPI) (written in Python + the Fast API framework) that I've coded to work with the [Iris data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

The main goal was to build, from start to finish (deploying it), an app that implements some machine learning model.
